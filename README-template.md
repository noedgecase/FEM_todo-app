## Overview

After several small projects and mini games made with javascript this todo app was my escape from the tutorials phase.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

<!-- ## My process -->

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

<!-- **Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices** -->

### What I learned

I managed to implement fundamentals such as looping arrays, the switch statement, aswell as get a taste of adding, deleting and styling elements through js.

### Continued development

On my next challenges I want to focus on writing cleaner javascript. This time I have only focused on getting the app to work leaving aside good code structure or best practices.
